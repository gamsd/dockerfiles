# Dockerfiles

This repository contains a mostly random assortment of helpful Dockerfiles to make life easier.

For the moment, both Dockerfiles in this repo are related to running [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) presentations. To get a grip on how to use them, please refer to the READMEs inside the respective examples folder or, even better, the [blog post](blog.gamsd.com/revealjs-docker-presentations/).
